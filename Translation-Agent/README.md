# Detect Language and Translate Agent

The Detect Language and Translate Agent is an **AI-assisted RPA workflow** developed using **UiPath Studio Web**.  
The automation detects the language of an input text and translates it into a target language in a structured and automated manner.

## 📌 Project Description

This project implements an intelligent automation workflow that processes unstructured text input, identifies the source language, and performs translation to a specified target language. The agent is designed as an **end-to-end RPA workflow**, focusing on automation, data handling, and structured output generation.

The workflow is fully orchestrated using UiPath cloud services and does not rely on external application code.
